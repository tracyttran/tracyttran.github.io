Our brains, as incredibly complex as they are, are electrical circuits. And some say that if we can replicate the circuits that comprise our thoughts then we can replicate what makes us human. It is naïve to say we will never be able to beat the Turing Test, or that we won’t achieve perfect human-like aesthetics. It’s only a matter of time. But when that time comes, what happens? Will we be able to resist making them perfect? It is not unbelievable to say they will develop an agency of their own, and perhaps that agency will be to cause harm towards us. But beyond that, there are complicated ethics, I think, of smart, indistinguishable-from-human robots. If they are perfect, and we can create the kind of perfection we desire, will we value less the imperfections that make us human? In turn, will we seek perfection in ourselves and others, perfection that is only attainable as a pure machine? I don’t think we understand the full implications of playing god yet.


Yet even if we created a robot that was conscious, that was intelligent by whatever metric the scientific community chose, that looked and talked and acted like us, I would say there’s still something missing. There’s a part of me that refuses to believe that everything we are – our choices, our emotions, our fear and our love – can be reduced to a set of algorithms. In Westworld, a show about a technologically advanced amusement park populated by remarkable human-like androids, a man asks a woman if she is real. She replies, “If you can’t tell, does it matter?”


I want to say it does.
