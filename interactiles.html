     <div class="pageblurb">
<p>The absence of tactile cues such as keys and buttons makes

touchscreens difficult to navigate for people with visual

impairments. Increasing tactile feedback and tangible

interaction on touchscreens can improve their accessibility.

However, prior solutions have either required hardware

customization or provided limited functionality with static

overlays. Prior investigation of tactile solutions for large

touchscreens also may not address the challenges on mobile devices. We therefore present Interactiles, a low-cost, portable, and unpowered system that enhances tactile

interaction on Android touchscreen phones. Interactiles

consists of 3D-printed hardware interfaces and software

that maps interaction with that hardware to manipulation of

a mobile app. The system is compatible with the built-in

screen reader without requiring modification of existing

mobile apps. We describe the design and implementation of

Interactiles, and we evaluate its improvement in task

performance and the user experience it enables with people

who are blind or have low vision.

signed as modular so the pieces can be interchanged.

<p>Pregnant women often get their bellies touched without their permission by people ranging from family members, to coworkers, to strangers. While usually well-intentioned, people who touch pregnant bellies are unaware that their actions may be unwanted and invasive. Previous works have shown that wearable computing can bring attention to social issues by provoking discourse. We implemented a maternity shirt that reacts to inappropriate touches upon contact in various ways, such as displaying messages, vibrating, and setting off an alarm. Through this interactive design piece we hoped to raise awareness and provoke conversation around themes of consent, inappropriate touching, and women's bodies.
