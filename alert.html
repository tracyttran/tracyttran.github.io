Introducing Alert: a personal safety system that leverages crowdsourcing to keep the campus community informed, in tandem with a smart backpack that alerts you to potential physical threats and contains an easily accessible alarm system in case of attack.

 

When walking and coming across a situation you want to alert others about, pull up the app to drop a location pin and type a quick report – “A group of drunk guys hanging out and shouting lewd comments on 45th and 18th”. This crowdsourced data populates a map available to anyone with the Alert app. The map is also populated by UW PD and Seattle PD incident reports.

 

When you come within 30 meters of a recently dropped incident pin – by the police or a community member – a notification LED on the backpack strap will light up. This tells you to check your app and potentially take a different route to avoid the incident reported earlier.

 

If the infrared sensor on the backpack detects a person behind you, the notification LED will also light up. This tells you to look around and stay aware, making you more ready to fend off a threat.

 

If the situation escalates and you feel unsafe, a quick touch to the backpack strap will set off an alarm and flashing lights, as well as activating a phone call to your trusted contact or the police. Homes with visible security systems and security signs in the front lawn deter robbers; flashing lights and an alarm draws attention to the scene, making you a less worthwhile risk for an attacker.
