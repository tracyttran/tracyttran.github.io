                <p> In partnership with the Woodland Park Zoo and their inclusivity mission, we developed a prototype
                    exhibit for children with visual impairments. Upon approach, the exhibit will give audio cues
                    explaining
                    how to interact with the exhibit. Visitors are encouraged to touch a detailed model of Eduardo the
                    three-banded armadillo animal ambassador. As visitors touch specific regions, audio will play giving
                    facts related to that part of the animal.
                    Such an exhibit is more inclusive compared to traditional zoo exhibits which rely on sight to view
                    animals or read informative signage. Even in cases where signs have audio-support, the addition of a
                    tactile model enables a more engaging experience.

                    <br><br>
                    The Woodland Park Zoo was excited about the prototype and was going to use it as a proof of concept
                    as they develope a more inclusive experience.
